Preparing these files in advance:
1.'bg_enricher.csv' in dir 'IN_enr_bg'
This is the background gene list for enrichment analysis.

2.'enr_.*DEGs.csv' in dir 'IN_enr_bg'
Only files with 'enr_' as header will be regarded as input gene list and applied for enrichment analysis.


DO NOT CHANGE these files in 'IN_enricher_prior':
prekegg2gene_pathway.csv
prekegg2gene_module.csv
module_list_wb.txt
pathway_list_wb.txt
